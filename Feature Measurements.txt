Latency: measured by RTT (Round Trip Time: this is the time taken to send a packet from one end of the connection to the other and back)
Bandwidth: how long it takes to send data (how many bits per second our connection can carry)
Connection Establishment: TCP establishes connections via a three-way handshake. The client sends a connection request, the server responds, and the client acknowledges the response. The client can send data along with the acknowledgement. Since the client must wait for the server to send its connection response, this procedure sets a lower bound on the transaction time of two RTTs.
Average time of "GET"
Average time to "POST"
5 longest request time
5 longest response time
response._fromCache: how many are from "disk", how many from "memory", how many from "cache"
